#BOGOBUY is an e-commerce website that was develped using angular services, and for the backend, node.js was used. I am using mLab which is a database cloud services that allows to host your database in the cloud, and sice the data is nonrelational, I dicided to go for mongoDB. CRUD system was implented into the server, only post request and and delete request have not yet been implemented into the server. API shows JSON Object that can be parsed thanks to the http service from angular.JS . Templetas from bootstrap were used in this project.
